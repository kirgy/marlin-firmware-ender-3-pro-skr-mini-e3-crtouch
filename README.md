# SKR Mini E3 CR-Touch Marlin firmware configuration
The following a fork of the [Marlin Firmware repo](`https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin`) with a working CR-Touch config applied over the top. This means you can simply build this repo in VSCode's Platform.io Plugin / Auto Build Marlin plugin.

This has been specifically configured for:
 - SKR Mini E3
 - Ender 3 Pro frame / board
 - CR-Touch
 - Auto bed-leveling
 - Using CR-Touch as Z-stop with no hardware z-stop connected
   - this is not the same thing as the BL-Touch

This has been tested on my personal hardware.
